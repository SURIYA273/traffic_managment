# AI Traffic Management System 🚦

## Overview
The **AI Traffic Management System** is a smart traffic control solution that uses artificial intelligence to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve road safety. By leveraging real-time data analysis, computer vision, and predictive algorithms, the system dynamically adjusts traffic signals to enhance efficiency.

## Features
- 🚗 **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: Uses cameras and sensors to analyze vehicle density.
- ⏳ **Adaptive Signal Control**: Adjusts traffic lights based on congestion levels.
- 📊 **Data Analytics**: Generates reports on traffic patterns and peak hours.
- 🛑 **Emergency Vehicle Detection**: Prioritizes emergency vehicles by clearing routes.
- 🌍 **Integration with Smart Cities**: Can be connected with IoT and cloud platforms for advanced monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Flask
- **Database**: Firebase / MySQL
- **Cloud & IoT**: AWS, Google Cloud, Raspberry Pi (for hardware integration)

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Install **Python** (>=3.8)
- Install required dependencies:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Set up a **Firebase/MySQL** database
- Configure API keys if using external services (Google Maps, AWS, etc.)
